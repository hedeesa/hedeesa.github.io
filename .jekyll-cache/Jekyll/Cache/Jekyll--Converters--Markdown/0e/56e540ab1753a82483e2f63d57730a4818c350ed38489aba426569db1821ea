I"<p>Finally I’m here.<br />
It took me months to decide how I want to contact with people on the Internet.
I’m active at Instagram and Twitter but I wanted to share some doc and notes too, not only my naggings and photos!<br />
So finally I came up with the idea of bringing up my personal Weblog, so here I am.<br />
well, you are going to hear of me mostly about technology here. but I may share some of my thoughts about life, work or anything that I believe worth sharing.</p>

<p>So Let’s start it…</p>
